## How It Works

The expert advisor follows a structured flow to perform various tasks. Here is an overview of the key functions and their purposes:

### `OnInit()`

This function is called during the expert advisor's initialization process. It performs the following tasks:

- If backtesting is enabled, it sets up the backtesting environment using the `SetupBacktesting()` function.
- It runs a compatibility test using the `TestCompatibility()` function.
- If the user interface is enabled, it sets up the user interface using the `SetupUserInterface()` function.
- If price monitoring is enabled, it sets up the price monitoring using the `SetupPriceMonitoring()` function.

### `OnDeinit(const int reason)`

This function is called during the expert advisor's deinitialization process. It is responsible for cleaning up any allocated resources.

### `OnTick()`

This function is called on each tick of the market. It performs the following tasks:

- If trade execution is enabled, it checks if an entry order has been placed. If not, it tries to open a trade using the `OpenTrade()` function. If an entry order exists, it tries to close the trade using the `CloseTrade()` function.
- If price monitoring is enabled, it calls the `MonitorPrice()` function to monitor price movements.

### `SetupBacktesting(const double simulationQuality)`

This function sets up the backtesting environment. Currently, the function returns true without performing any specific logic. Users can customize this function to set up their desired backtesting environment.

### `TestCompatibility()`

This function performs a compatibility test. The compatibility test logic is not provided in this code sample, and the result is determined by the `compatibilityTestPassed` flag.

### `SetupUserInterface()`

### `SetupPriceMonitoring()`

### `CloseTrade()`
